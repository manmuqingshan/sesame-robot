# 3D Printing Guide

Sesame is designed to be printed in **PLA**. Most parts are designed to be printed without supports, but the internal frame and body cover both require supports in specific spots. The 3D Printing guide shows exactly where to place these supports for each part, and some recommended settings to get the best results.

## Recommended Settings
*   **Material:** PLA / PLA+
*   **Infill:** 15-20%
*   **Supports:** Minimal (Check individual file notes)

For specific part orientations and support placement, please refer to the build guide.
